# NewX
NewX is a open-source free game I am doing just for fun. 

NewX first started named Atramento when I was in High school. 
I decided to make a 2D vertical game for fun with Slick2D. 
Atramento is Ink in latin, I chose this name because the game 
was supposed to be about collecting Ink and drawing your own character. 

But that concept has been discontinued and I just decided to do 
a simple platformer. For the end of my High school, I had to make 
a final project and it could be about anything. So I took 
Atramento, turned it into Coureur des Prairies (since it had to 
be in french) and made a final game from it. I had to make all 
sprites from myself because it is a personnal project and I 
wasn't allowed to accept anyone's help. So that's why it doesn't 
look good. 

After that, I decided to continue my project, making 
major changes in the code structure. I also wanted the game to 
be multi-lang so I renamed it to NewX. So now, NewX is a game without 
any goal. NewX's name is coming from the X movements of the 
player. The game currently has some gravity, a health system 
for entities, a lot of random furniture and 2 entities (Player 
and Slime).

Current sprites of the game are completely random. Some have been taken
from google, others have been draw from friends I even made some by 
myself. I do not claim to own any of the sprites used in the game. I own 
all the sounds though. (including music)
