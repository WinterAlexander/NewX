# NewX
Hi ! Let me introduce you to NewX

NewX is a open-source free game I am doing just for fun. 
I'm not actively working on the project but if other people 
are interested by NewX, I may turn it into a serious project.

NewX first started named Atramento when I was in secondary 4 
(High school in Quebec). I decided to make a 2D vertical game 
for fun with Slick2D. Atramento is Ink in latin, I choosed 
this name because the game were suppose to be about collecting 
Ink and drawing your own character. But that concept has been 
abandonned and I just decided to do a simple platformer. 
In secondary 5, (the last year of my high school) I had to make 
a final project and it could be about anything. So I took 
Atramento, turned it into Coureur des Prairies (my school is 
french) and made a final game from it. I had to make all 
sprites from myself because it is a personnal project and I 
wasn't allowed to accept anyone's help. So that's why it doesn't 
look  good. 

After that, I decided to continue my project, making 
major changes in the code structure. I also wanted the game to 
be multi-lang so I renamed it to NewX (Coureur des Prairies 
really sucked as a name too). So now, NewX is a game without 
any goal. NewX's name is coming from the X movements of the 
player. The game currently has some gravity, a health system 
for entities, a lot of random furniture and 2 entities (Player 
and Slime). The slime isn't finished though. 

If you are interested by me or my game, do not hesitate to 
contact me. If you have an idea of an interesting scenario or 
theme, I have 100% open to suggestions. If you want to make 
some sprites I'm also open. If you draw me a monster or a car, 
I will be happy to add it to the game. (It can be anything, 
not only monsters and cars)

Current sprites of the game are completely random. Some have been taken
from google, others have been draw from friends I even made some by 
myself. <b>IF ANY RESOURCE USED BY MY GAME IS VIOLATING YOUR COPYRIGHTS,
